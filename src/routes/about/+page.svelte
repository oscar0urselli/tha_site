<p class="ibm-plex-mono-regular">Ciao, I’m Oscar Urselli from Italy and I’m a student of computer engineering.</p>

<p class="ibm-plex-mono-regular">My interest for computer started with Minecraft and programming command blocks. Later I was curios on self hosting a Minecraft server and learning more about game development. At the moment these are the languages I know:</p>
<ul class="ibm-plex-mono-regular">
    <li>
        <p><strong>Python</strong> - Self-taught during highschool, used for almost everything. I created Discord and Telegram bots, web scrapers, some basic AI with TensorFlow, serial communication with Arduino and mandatory in cybersecurity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Rust</strong> - Loved from the first moment, now is my primary language. I use it for almost everything: system programming, dekstop applications (Tauri), networking and other stuff.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Java & C#</strong> - I wrote some code with both but mostly in C# with Unity. Apparently IT companies love bloated software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>C++</strong> - I started learning C++ in highschool, but went way further compared to what was the program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>HTML CSS JS</strong> - Mandatory to learn for frontend development.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>TypeScript</strong> - I started with JavaScript on Node.js because I wanted to create an API. At first I studied Express.js but later I discovered SvelteKit and it was a no brainer move. At the moment I use whenever I can TypeScript in order to limit all the issues present in JavaScript.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Redis, MySQL, SQLite, Postgres, DuckDB</strong> - MySQL was my first approach to RDBMS and SQL, later I discovered the world of NoSQL databases and so I started using Redis for some projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Docker</strong> - Started learning about it during the training for CyberChallenge.IT, now I use it during development and for production.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="ibm-plex-mono-medium-italic">I use Debian by the way.</p>
