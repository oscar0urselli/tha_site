*Firegex is a firewall that includes different functionalities, created for CTF Attack-Defence competitions that has the aim to limit or totally deny malicious traffic through the use of different kind of filters.* More infos at this [page](https://github.com/Pwnzer0tt1/firegex)...


Development started about 2 weeks before the final of [CyberChallenge.IT 2022](https://cyberchallenge.it/attack-defense/2022). At the beginning, the idea was of having a way to block potential payload from other players until we where able to patch the exploited vulnerabilities.

Now, the project has evolved and is capable of doing much more than simply dropping packet based on a set of regular expressions.
