      <description>Firegex is a firewall that includes different functionalities, created for CTF Attack-Defence competitions that has the aim to limit or totally deny malicious traffic through the use of different kind of filters. More infos at this page&amp;hellip;&#xA;Development started about 2 weeks before the final of CyberChallenge.IT 2022. At the beginning, the idea was of having a way to block potential payload from other players until we where able to patch the exploited vulnerabilities.</description>
