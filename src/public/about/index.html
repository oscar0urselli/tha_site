<p>Ciao, I&rsquo;m Oscar Urselli from Italy and I&rsquo;m a student of computer engineering.</p>
<h2 id="about-cat-readmetxt">~/about$ cat README.txt</h2>
<p>My interest for computer started with Minecraft and programming command blocks. Later I was curios on self hosting a Minecraft server and learning more about game development. At the moment these are the languages I know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python</strong> - Self-taught during highschool, used for almost everything. I created Discord and Telegram bots, web scrapers, some basic AI with TensorFlow, serial communication with Arduino and mandatory in cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong> - I&rsquo;m learning it beacause of a course of algorithm and data structure in university.</li>
<li><strong>C++</strong> - I started learning C++ in highschool, but went way further compared to what was the program.</li>
<li><strong>HTML CSS JS</strong> - Mandatory to learn for frontend development and cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>TypeScript/JavaScript</strong> - I started with JavaScript on Node.js because I wanted to create an API. At first I studied Express.js but later I discovered SvelteKit and it was a no brainer move. At the moment I use whenever I can TypeScript in order to limit all the issues present in JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>Redis, MySQL, SQLite</strong>: MySQL was my first approach to RDBMS and SQL, later I discovered the world of NoSQL databases and so I started using Redis for some projects.</li>
<li><strong>Solidity</strong>: I have a strong interest towards blockchain and the technology behind it, so it made sense to also learn one of the most used language for the creation of smart contract.</li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Started learning about it during the training for CyberChallenge.IT, now I use it during development and for production.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I use Ubuntu by the way.</em></p>
