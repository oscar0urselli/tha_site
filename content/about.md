## ~/about$ whoami
Ciao, I'm Oscar Urselli from Italy and I'm a student of computer engineering.

## ~/about$ cat README.txt
My interest for computer started with Minecraft and programming command blocks. Later I was curios on self hosting a Minecraft server and learning more about game development. At the moment these are the languages I know:
 - **Python** - Self-taught during highschool, used for almost everything. I created Discord and Telegram bots, web scrapers, some basic AI with TensorFlow, serial communication with Arduino and mandatory in cybersecurity.
 - **Java** - I'm learning it beacause of a course of algorithms and data structures at my university.
 - **C++** - I started learning C++ in highschool, but went way further compared to what was the program.
 - **HTML CSS JS** - Mandatory to learn for frontend development and cybersecurity.
 - **TypeScript/JavaScript** - I started with JavaScript on Node.js because I wanted to create an API. At first I studied Express.js but later I discovered SvelteKit and it was a no brainer move. At the moment I use whenever I can TypeScript in order to limit all the issues present in JavaScript.
 - **Redis, MySQL, SQLite**: MySQL was my first approach to RDBMS and SQL, later I discovered the world of NoSQL databases and so I started using Redis for some projects.
 - **Solidity**: I have a strong interest towards blockchain and the technology behind it, so it made sense to also learn one of the most used language for the creation of smart contract.
 - **Docker**: Started learning about it during the training for CyberChallenge.IT, now I use it during development and for production.

*I use Ubuntu by the way.*
